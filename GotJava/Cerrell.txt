What's up!? This is Cerrell the Java II student who is working like crazy just to stay afloat.

As of 4/10/18 I am 29 years of age and expecting my first child in September this year.

I have a old, but reliable Toyota Camry that gets me from A to B without any problems.
However, when I am not doing store runs in the grocery getter, I am on my GSX-R 750 getting from A to B 

in 2.5 seconds lol.

Now you know a tiny bit about me. Wrapping it up! Stay cool and enjoy the rest of your day!
